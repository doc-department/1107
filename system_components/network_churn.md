# Network churn
Network churn is a term to describe Vaults going off line frequently and without notice. This is a situation that favours a very fast reconfiguring network.

A Vaults distance from an address is a measure of that Vaults authority to make decisions on that address in a particular circumstance.

In terms of data loss, the replicated copies of data are spread across the network in a random and uniform manner. This should put data copies far away from each other.

The network holds multiple on line and off line copies in a manner that the mixture maintains the most efficient Vaults holding data based on its use and also the Vaults on line times.

In terms of security, churn prevents attacks as the point of access is constantly moving.

As the network re-configures quickly on churn events the shape of the network alters around any data.

As the network grows this churn provides even greater security as the Vaults close to data are altering faster.
