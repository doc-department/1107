# Wallet
The SAFE Network wallet is defined as a place holding the credits and the credit change history for an account.

The safecoin data also served as "wallet" to itself, i.e. a wallet that holds one token only. A user level bookkeeper, holding the list of token one user owns, can be completed as a client only application. That list of token information can be stored in user's local machine or uploaded to the network as encrypted data.
