# Wallet
The SAFE Network wallet is a place that holds the credits and the credit change history for an account.

When a user joins the SAFE Network, they automatically have a wallet. As a reward for providing resources for the SAFE Network, they receive safecoins. These safecoins are stored in the user's wallet.

These safecoins can then be used to buy more resources, applications, or traded for other digital currencies or cash through an exchange service.

A user can view the contents of their wallet through the MaidSafe client.
