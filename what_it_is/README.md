#What it is
The SAFE Network is a secure and fully distributed data management service. The network is made up from the unused computer resources provided by the individual network users.

Each user of the SAFE Network provides a small part of their computer resources; hard-drive storage, CPU power, and bandwidth. This local resource is called a vault. Each vault is cryptographically secure and connects to other vaults throughout the network.

##Data on the SAFE Network
As a user saves their data or interacts with applications, their data is broken up, encrypted, and then distributed throughout the network to other vaults. These vaults are independent and autonomous, each storing a small part of the encrypted data.

When the user needs to access their data they simply log into the SAFE Network and retrieve their data. At no point does the user’s password or login details get sent out into the network. Each piece of data is encrypted using the data itself and the user’s login details.

No data is stored or cached locally and can only be accessed by users with the right keys. This means that there is no synchronisation required whenever a user needs to access their data.

As new users join the SAFE Network they each provide additional resources and storage space. This means that as the network grows, so does its capacity to store and manage data.

##Apps and programs on the SAFE Network

The SAFE Network is also a platform for apps and programs that can be accessed by the network users.

There are many examples of the type of apps that can be used on the SAFE Network.

* Cloud storage
* Encrypted messaging
* Web sites
* Document processing of any data provided by any program
* Distributed databases
* Document or contract signing
* Any many more

The apps and programs contain cryptographically secured key pairs and can use these to automatically sign requests for session management or membership of any network service.

For example, a website with membership can present a join button and merely clicking that would sign an authority and allow access in the future.

##Costs of using the SAFE Network

Initially there is no cost to use the SAFE Network at least to store data and communicate securely. As the network grows this may change and may require payment (in safecoin - a token-based currency of the SAFE Network) if the user requires more data storage space. If further access is required then safecoin may be purchased to 'buy' more space or pay for non-free applications.
