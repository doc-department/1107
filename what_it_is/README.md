#What it is
The SAFE Network is a secure and fully distributed data management service. The network is made up from the unused computer resources provided by the individual network users.

Each user of the SAFE Network provides a small part of their computer resources; hard-drive storage, CPU power, and bandwidth. This local resource is called a vault. Each vault is cryptographically secure and connects to other vaults throughout the network.

The user's data is encrypted and broken up into chunks. These chunks are then distributed around other vaults in the network. At no point do any of the other vaults know anything about the data they have been asked to store other than anonymous network address information.

As a result of the encryption and network-wide distribution of data it is impossible for anyone else to see the users original data.

The SAFE Network also supports applications and programs that can be accessed by network users. These applications may be free to use or paid for by using safecoins.

Safecoin is the currency of the SAFE network. It is a digital currency that only exists in the SAFE Network. It is is used to buy more access to more storage or applications. Users can earn safecoins by providing more storage space or by providing applications.

As the SAFE Network grows, the value of the limited safecoins also grows. As the safecoins are only digitally authorised using the current and previous safecoin owner, there is no transaction history.
