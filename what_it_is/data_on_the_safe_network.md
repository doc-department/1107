#Data on the SAFE Network

As a user saves their data or interacts with applications, their data is broken up, encrypted, and then distributed throughout the network to other vaults. These vaults are independent and autonomous, each storing a small part of the encrypted data.

When the user needs to access their data they simply log into the SAFE Network and retrieve their data. At no point does the user’s password or login details get sent out into the network. Each piece of data is encrypted using the data itself and the user’s login details.
No data is stored or cached locally and can only be accessed by users with the right keys. This means that there is no synchronisation required whenever a user needs to access their data.

As new users join the SAFE Network they each provide additional resources and storage space. This means that as the network grows, so does its capacity to store and manage data.
