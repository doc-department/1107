# Safecoins
Safecoins are the currency of the SAFE Network. They are a token-based scheme that is only used inside the SAFE Network. Safecoins are used for buying additional resources, for example, storage space, or access to network applications. All safecoins are saved in a user's wallet which is a small part of their vault.

When a user provides space for the SAFE Network that is greater than the amount they use, they will earn safecoins. This is called farming. With these safecoins they can then buy more storage or premium applications. Although, initially a lot of the applications on the SAFE Network will be free to use.

Transfers of safecoins between users is managed automatically by transaction managers. These transaction managers are just more vaults that have the safecoin transaction management persona. The transaction managers ensure that safecoins are digitally signed correctly and are never deleted or corrupted.

As there can be multiple transaction managers coordinating transfers of safecoins the transfer happens at network speed.

A safecoin is a piece of digital information. The only historical data held with a safecoin is the current user's details and the previous owner's details. These details are only used for verification purposes. This means that safecoins can be thought of as digital cash, leaving no audit trail.

As the network grows, the amount of available safecoins also grows. This means that the amount of safecoins available is directly linked to the amount of resource available in the SAFE Network. As a result the value of the safecoin is maintained and is relative to the network size.
