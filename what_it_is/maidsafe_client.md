# MaidSafe client
The MaidSafe client is a small program that is used to log in to the SAFE Network. After starting the MaidSafe client you are asked to provide log in details.

* User name
* Password or PIN
* Password phrase or words

With these details the SAFE Network authenticates you on the SAFE Network and then provides access to your encrypted data.

The MaidSafe client is small program so does not impact your PCs performance. Also the easy to use interface makes accessing the SAFE Network instantaneous. After you have been authenticated through the MaidSafe client you will not have to enter further passwords or keys to access other shared data or apps.

No passwords or log in details are cached by the MaidSafe client. This means that no details about you or your access security is left on the PC you have used to access the SAFE Network. When you log into SAFE Network from another PC that has the MaidSafe client installed, you will still be able to see all your data and apps.
