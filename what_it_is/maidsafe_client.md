# MaidSafe client
The MaidSafe client is a program used to log in to the SAFE Network. After starting the MaidSafe client you are asked to provide log in details.

* User name
* Password or PIN
* Password phrase or words

With these details the SAFE Network authenticates you on the SAFE Network and then provides access to your encrypted data.

The MaidSafe client is a small program so does not impact your PCs performance. After you have been authenticated through the MaidSafe client you do not have to enter further passwords or keys to access other shared data or apps on the SAFE Network.

No passwords or log in details are cached by the MaidSafe client. This means that no details about you or your access security is left on the PC you have used to access the SAFE Network. You can log in to the SAFE Network from another PC that has the MaidSafe client installed.
