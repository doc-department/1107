# MaidSafe client
The MaidSafe client is a program used to log in to SAFE Network and to make requests to the network. After starting the MaidSafe client you are asked to provide login details.

* User name
* PIN
* Password

With these details the SAFE Network authenticates the user on the SAFE Network and decrypts their data atlas, which provides them with access to all their encrypted data.

The MaidSafe client is a small, cross-platform and non-resource intensive program that does not impact your computer's performance. After you have been authenticated through the MaidSafe client you do not have to enter further passwords or keys to access other shared data or apps on the SAFE Network.

No passwords or log in details are cached by the MaidSafe client. This means that no details about you or your access security is left on the PC you have used to access the SAFE Network. You can log in to the SAFE Network from another PC that has the MaidSafe client installed.
