# Wallets
Wallets are virtual storage locations for safecoins. The user's wallet contains a digital record of the safecoins owned by a user. As a user provides more storage or an App Builder provides more applications, their wallet balance will increase as additional resources are provided.

An App Builder is a user that creates applications that can be used on the SAFE Network.

A user's wallet is created when they join the SAFE Network.

The wallet is part of the user's vault so correspondingly it is encrypted and distributed around other vaults in the network. This means that a user's wallet can be accessed from any device connected to the SAFE Network. Also, because data in the wallet is cryptographically encoded, the contents of the wallet is secure and can not be deleted.

When safecoins are transferred from one wallet to another the transfer is managed by the transaction managers and transaction validators. This ensures that the correct amount is debited and credited to the right wallets and that all transactions are validated.
