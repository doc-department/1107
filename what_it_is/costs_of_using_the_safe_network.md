#Accessing the SAFE Network

To use the SAFE Network each user will require safecoins. Safecoins are the token-based currency of the SAFE Network.

To earn safecoins users can do the following:

* Donating spare computer resources to the network
* Creating network applications
* Contributing to the underlying SAFE Network codebase.

It is anticipated that soon after public launch, it will also be possible to buy safecoins from decentralised exchanges that will exist on the SAFE Network.
