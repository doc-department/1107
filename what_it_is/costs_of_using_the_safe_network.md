#Costs of using the SAFE Network

Initially there is no cost to use the SAFE Network at least to store data and communicate securely. As the network grows this may change and may require payment (in safecoin - a token-based currency of the SAFE Network) if the user requires more data storage space. If further access is required then safecoin may be purchased to 'buy' more space or pay for non-free applications.
