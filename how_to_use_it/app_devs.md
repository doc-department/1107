# An App Builder

<<<<<<< HEAD
The seemingly eternal question for developers; what's the business model? Is it build applications to support them? or perhaps provide consulting? None of these seem to have much to do with the core skill of the developer, that is coding.  What about commercial applications, how much to charge, what revenue model, how many users...etc... These are all questions start-ups and existing projects must evaluate. What if the answer to both of these questions was, provide something people value and you will be automatically rewarded!
=======
As an App Builder, developers create apps which run on the SAFE Network using the open source MaidSafe API, making use of the resources provided by Farmers on the network.  In doing so, they are rewarded with safecoins in proportion to how much the application is used.

An example app is available [here](http://blog.maidsafe.net/2014/04/21/safe-network-sample-app-features/).

Due to the open source libraries provided in the API, developing an app is low cost and supported by the development community. The nature of the SAFE Network ensures anonymity, crytographic security and privacy to all users of the app by design, and also provides decentralized resources which react in real-time to the demand from the app users.

The provision of safecoin rewards based on usage allows the App Builder to focus on creating apps which users seek to use, knowing that the revenue stream is already built in by the SAFE Network.
