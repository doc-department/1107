# A Farmer

As a user of the SAFE Network, a Farmer installs the MaidSafe client and provides unused computer resources to the network such as storage, CPU processing, and network bandwidth. These resources are used to securely and anonymously participate in the decentralised transactions which make up the SAFE Network via the local Vault on the Farmer's computer, which is installed as part of the Maidsafe client.

When the resources provided exceed those which are used by a Farmer, they earn safecoins in exchange for providing these resources. The safecoins earned can then be used by the Farmer, for example, by exchanging them for additional storage.

The Farmer can also run apps and programs which have been designed for use on the SAFE Network, to make use of the resources available on the network.
