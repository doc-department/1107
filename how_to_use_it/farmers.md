# A Farmer

As a user of the SAFE Network, a Farmer installs the MaidSafe client and provides unused computer resources to the network such as storage, CPU processing, and network bandwidth. These resources are used to securely and anonymously participate in the decentralised transactions which make up the SAFE Network. This is done using the local Vault on the Farmer's computer, which is installed as part of the Maidsafe client.

When the resources provided exceed those which are used by the Farmer, they earn safecoins in exchange for providing these resources. This is indicated to the Farmer by a notification from the Maidsafe client. The safecoins earned can then be used by the Farmer, for example, by exchanging them for additional storage.

The Farmer can also run apps and programs which have been designed for use on the SAFE Network.
