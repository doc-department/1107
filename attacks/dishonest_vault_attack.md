# Dishonest Vault Attack

##Attack Description

This attack assumes that a vault falsely claims to offer more storage capacity to the ability to join particular areas of the network.

##Attack Purpose

If parts of the network were attacked in such a manner then there may be opportunities to create fake rules to be introduced. In a large scale attack fo this kind considerable network damage could occur. Theft of safecoin, double spend, delete data etc. would all be possible.

##Attack Avoidance

Possible mitigations for this attack include legitimate nodes on the network being instructed to increase the required quorum level required for a request to be accepted. Whether this attack is viable, and the point at which it would become viable, is a topic for further research. This is an ongoing research area.

Further research into the number of malicious nodes necessary to make the network effectively unavailable is also likely necessary. Theoretically, if a botnet or other group of malicious nodes were to make up around 75% of the network, they could achieve false quorum over invalid requests, and thus request erase data, or modify mutable data.

It is more likely that an attacker obtaining control of around 75% of the network would pose more signiÔ¨Åcant threats though, such as simply destroying user trust in the network, such as the so-called 50% attack often seen in cryptographic currencies.
